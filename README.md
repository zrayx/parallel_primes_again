# parallel_primes_again

Compare Zig and Rust, see also https://github.com/zrayx/parallel_primes.

Zig pros:
* Legibility
  * The source code of the standard library is very readable
* Much easier to implement code

Zig cons:
* Documentation
  * Still early work in progress
  * Being able to read the standard library and other people's code makes it much less of an issue
* Tool support
  * Couldn't get zls/debugging to work out of the box in vim or vs code.
* A hair slower than rust for very similar code
